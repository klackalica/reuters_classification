"SHULTZ USSR TRIP FUELS TALK OF EEP WHEAT OFFER","Speculation the United States will offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union appears to have reached a new level of intensity in the run up to Secretary of State George Shultz visit later this month to Moscow Rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheat markets since officials from the two countries held their customary semi annual grain talks in February Moscow s decision at that time to reenter the U S corn market strengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April Shultz statement two weeks ago that he would not stand in the way of a wheat subsidy offer under the Export Enhancement Program EEP coupled with the announcement of his visit to Moscow was interpreted by many grain trade representatives here as a clear signal that the Reagan administration was preparing an offer Administration officials in and out of the U S Agriculture Department have been extremely tight lipped about the prospects of a subsidy offer But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned the contention the proposal is dormant suggesting that an offer while not a done deal is a live possibility Prominent U S grain trade representatives many of whom asked not to be identified continue to maintain that an offer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent Others who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible are saying they would not rule one out Rep Pat Roberts R Kan yesterday went so far as to predict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten days to two weeks Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaders who had been in contact with administration officials Richard Fritz director of international marketing at U S Wheat Associates said he was confident an export enhancement offer would be made by the middle of this month Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would end up being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier this year when USDA approved subsidies to China of around dlrs per tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat Some grain trade representatives say a four mln tonne wheat subsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases of U S corn and open the door to U S sales of soybeans As ever one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat deal would appear to be price Last summer the administration took the controversial step of offering the Soviets subsidized wheat but were embarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the grounds that the dlr per tonne subsidy still left U S wheat prices far above world market prices The administration s decision to set the subsidy level up front instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be a means of controlling the price while attempting to dampen criticism grain trade sources said Nonetheless the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultz from saying the Soviets were chortling because Washington was offering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available to U S housewives The conventional wisdom among grain trade representatives here is that a general warming of relations between the two countries since last summer combined with continued hard times in the U S grain belt would favor a subsidy offer In addition the USSR has made it clear it would consider buying U S wheat if it were priced more competitively However observers have not forgotten the circumstances surrounding the administration s announcement of the wheat subsidy offer last summer Up until the time of the announcment congressional and industry leaders were led to believe the White House had decided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include not only the Soviets but also a much broader list of countries Instead the administration scaled back the offer to include only the Soviets That last minute change of heart adds a measure of uncertainty even to the predictions of those most convinced that the administration will not now pass up the opportunity to sell four mln tonnes of wheat to the Soviet Union Reuter"

"CURRENCY INTERVENTION TIMING CRUCIAL ANALYSTS","The dollar s recent decline despite massive central bank purchases is a forceful reminder that official intervention in the foreign exchanges can work only if it is well timed to coincide with shifts in market fundamentals or sentiment dealers and analysts said Central banks may succeed in slowing a trend but without accompanying policy changes they stand little chance of reversing the direction of an ever growing global market in which more than billion dlrs is traded every day the sources said Timing and psychology are the key to successful intervention said Jim O Neill a financial markets economist with Marine Midland Banks Inc The importance of complementary changes in economic fundamentals was underlined yesterday when a change in interest rates boosted the dollar instantly achieving what the central banks had tried in vain to do for a week through open market intervention After Citibank raised its prime rate by a quarter point to pct the first change in the rate since last August the dollar started to advance and reached a high in Tokyo of yen up two yen from Tuesday s New York low By contrast monetary authorities spearheaded by the Bank of Japan are estimated to have bought as much as billion dlrs in the last days of March but could not prevent the dollar from skidding through yen and plumbing a year low Monday of yen Some experts worry the central banks have lost more than just a temporary battle to prop up the dollar The market is wary of being caught wrong footed by a central bank foray but is no longer mesmerized They ve lost their credibility The market feels it can take on the central banks and win said Michael Snow head of treasury operations at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York The relative failure of recent intervention stands in sharp contrast to the success that central banks scored when they joined forces to drive the dollar down following the September Plaza accord Then however central banks had an easy time of it because the markets and the Treasuries of the major industrial powers were agreed that the dollar needed to head lower to redress massive worldwide trade imbalances Now there is no such consensus The market is saying that the dollar must fall further because the U S trade deficit is showing little sign of improvement while Japan is resisting in a bid to protect its export industries For its part the United States is apparently content to let the dollar fall gradually further and is paying little more than lip service to the February Paris agreement of the Group of Five plus Canada to foster stability dealers say Specifically they said the Fed s dollar buying intervention has been half hearted designed more as a political gesture to Japan than to strike fear into the markets It s been pro forma intervention said Francoise Soares Kemp chief corporate trader at Credit Lyonnais Because of this discord and the market s momentum for a lower dollar analysts said intervention looks doomed to fail It s going to take a lot more than the central banks to hold the dollar at these levels said Snow who predicts another to pct depreciation There have to be structural changes that occur to make the market stop selling dollars added Buying six billion dollars in three weeks is not going to do it Late last decade during the presidency of Jimmy Carter when the dollar was last under heavy speculative attack central banks sometimes intervened to the tune of six billion dlrs in a single day but still failed to stop the dollar falling to a record low of marks analysts said Snow said purchases on that scale now are unlikely I don t think anybody has the stomach for it because they saw the futility of it in the seventies Indeed because the market has grown in leaps and bound since then intervention on an even greater scale would probably be needed to impress the market Trading volume in London New York and Tokyo alone last year averaged nearly billion dlrs a day according to a joint central bank study about double the previous estimate made just two years earlier by the Group of Thirty private research group There are signs that central banks too realize the futility of swimming against the tide Bank of Japan sources told Reuters in Tokyo earlier this week that they believed the limits of currency market intervention are perhaps being reached and that other methods for bolstering the dollar such as invoking currency swap agreements with other central banks are being considered In this era of financial liberalization it s almost impossible to control the flow of capital in and out of Japan one senior official in Tokyo said Reuter"

"ICO QUOTAS BEFORE OCTOBER UNLIKELY DELEGATES","The restoration of coffee export quotas before the end of the current coffee year Oct Sept now seems unlikely given reluctance by International Coffee Organization ICO producers and consumers to resume negotiations on an interim quota accord producer delegates told reporters Consumers and most producers see no point in reopening the quota dialogue while Brazil s position remains unchanged they said Brazil s refusal to accept a reduction in its previous pct share of the ICO s global export quota effectively torpedoed talks here last month aimed at restoring quotas before October the delegates noted Disappointment at the lack of progress on quotas forced coffee futures in London and New York to new lows today traders here said Near May in New York fell below one dlr in early trading at around cents per pound traders said Producer delegates said that while the possibility of reimposing quotas before October remained on the ICO agenda in practice the idea had effectively been discarded The ICO s executive board session here this week has so far barely touched on the quota debate demonstrating general unwillingness to revive talks while chances of success are still remote producer delegates said Some producers are in no hurry to see quotas restored despite the price collapse seen since the failure of last month s negotiations they said With Brazil s frost season approaching who wants to negotiate quotas one leading producer delegate said Coffee prices normally rise during Brazil s frost season mainly June August as dealers and roasters build up stocks as insurance against possible severe frost damage to Brazil s crop Many producers are more interested in working towards reimposing quotas from October based on a new system of quota allocations valid until the International Coffee Agreement expires in they said Guatemala has already proposed the other oilds producer group should meet in the next two months to begin talks on how to allocate quota shares Producers still seem divided on how to overhaul the quota distribution system with some producer delegates reporting growing support for a radical reallocation based on the principle of objective criteria favoured by consumers At last month s council session a splinter group of small producers backed consumer demands for new quota shares based on exportable production and stocks while Brazil Colombia and the rest of the producers favoured leaving quota allocations unchanged except for some temporary adjustments A delegate from one of the eight said more producers now supported their cause The delegate said unless major producers like Brazil showed readiness to negotiate new quota shares prospects for a quota accord in October also looked bleak The U S and most other consumers are still determined to make reimposition of quotas conditional on a redistribution of quota shares based on objective criteria ICO observers remained sceptical that Brazil would be prepared to accept a quota reduction when the ICO council meets in September Brazil has adopted a tough stance with banks on external debt negotiations and is likely to be just as tough on coffee they said They said Brazil s reluctance to open coffee export registrations might reflect fears this would provoke another price slide and force an emergency ICO council session which would most likely end in failure Producers met this afternoon to review the market situation but had only a general discussion about how further negotiations should proceed a producer delegate said Producers plan to hold consultations on quotas and then may set a date for a formal producer meeting but plans are not fixed he said The ICO executive board reconvened at hours local time to hear a report from consultants on ICO operations The board meeting looks set to end today a day earlier than scheduled delegates said Reuter"

"EXCHANGE SEEN APPROVING WHEN ISSUED GILT TRADE","The Stock Exchange is virtually certain to agree to change its regulations in order to permit when issued trading of U K Government bonds gilts as part of an experimental series of bond auctions later this year market sources said The principle that this when issued trading should take place has been accepted by the Executive Committee of the International Stock Exchange said George Nissen chairman of the Gilt Edged Market Makers Association GEMMA It s a question of how rather than whether he told Reuters The Bank of England announced in February that it planned a possible series of experimental auctions for gilts similar to the system used to market U S Treasury issues with the first auction possibly in April or May The Bank said at that stage that it was not opposed in principle to when issued trading developing in bonds in the period between the announcement of full details of the auction and the auction itself as in the U S However when issued trading is prohibited under the rules of the International Stock Exchange formerly the London Stock Exchange and would require an amendment in order to proceed Nissen said discussions on the technical details of a rule change to allow when issued trading were still taking place between the Government broker at the Bank of England and the Quotations Department of the Stock Exchange The gilt edged primary dealers regard the introduction of grey market trading as an essential feature of an auction system covering part of the Government s funding needs If we are going into an auction system we need to have some form of market test of the stock we re bidding for said Simon Hartnell Head Trader at primary dealer Alexanders Laing and Cruickshank Gilts Ltd The American WI when issued market certainly functions very efficiently he said Nissen said he believed that if when issued trading were not allowed market makers would be extremely unhappy about the whole auction Gilt dealers noted that it was a basic provision of Stock Exchange rules that dealing could not take place in a stock until it was listed by the Quotations Department However this was mainly designed to prevent a grey market springing up in equities prior to listing They pointed out that in contrast to the many uncertainties connected with an issue of equity securities there would be few imponderables relating to bonds just about to be issued by the Bank of England Senior market sources noted that in any case when issued trading would be supervised by the Stock Exchange and would be subject to Bank of England supervisory guidelines Since the Bank of England and market makers themselves are known to be in favour of the idea the sources said there was now a presumption that there would be scope for when issued trading to take place Gilt sales now are effected by means of large scale stock tenders or by tap issues of stock tranches direct to the market But greater market capitalisation following the Big Bang restructuring last year provided an opportunity for change A combination of both systems would enable the Bank to benefit from both the flexibility offered by traditional marketing methods and the guarantee of a steady supply of funds implied by auctions The Bank said in a consultative document published in February that possibly two or three experimental auctions might each raise between one to billion stg The remainder of the funding would be conducted by traditional tender and tap issue means Total gross official sales of gilt edged stock were billion stg in Nissen said that market makers had agreed unanimously with the bank s view that auctions would be more easily conducted on a price basis rather than based on yield He said that the odds were also in favour of adoption of a bid price form of auction where successful bidders were allotted stock at the various prices at which they bid rather than a common price allotment whereby stock was allocated at the lowest accepted price Hartnell said that while a when issued facility was crucial to market makers adaptation to the new system he would also have liked to see an extension to the fallow period proposal made by the Bank of England The Bank said that it would not sell by any method stock of the same type as that to be auctioned between the time of the announcement of auction details and a period ending days after the auction itself Noting that in the case of long bond auctions U S Primary dealers have as much as three months between successive sales of stock Hartnell said the Bank s proposal was very tight Nissen said that following a meeting between GEMMA and the Bank of England on March which he described as very helpful GEMMA submitted a note making several further residual points Market makers are now awaiting a further fairly definitive paper from the Bank which would contain details of auction procedures Although the Bank has not yet formally announced a definite intention to proceed with the auctions most market participants assume that they will go ahead My own view is that we are on course and the first indications from the

"EC AGREES ON NEED TO STRENGTHEN EMS","European Community EC finance ministers and central bankers agreed on the need for greater cooperation to strengthen the European Monetary System EMS against international market turbulence officials said There was a general will to reinforce the European Monetary System with all that implies Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens said yesterday after hosting a one day session of informal talks at this Belgian coastal resort The gathering was the first such discussion since the second major realignment of EMS parities within nine months in January The system has come under severe strain as funds have flowed out of the slumping dollar and into the dominant EMS currency the West German mark sending it soaring against weaker currencies in the system But Eyskens said February s agreement between leading western industrialised nations to stabilise exchange rates at around current levels was working and this would allow the EC to speed up its efforts to boost the internal stability of the EMS He told a news conference yesterday s meeting agreed on the need for closer coordination among EMS member governments of interest rate policies and of interest rate differentials between different countries They also agreed they needed better coordination of exchange market intervention to hold currencies stable both when they reached their fixed EMS limits and within their agreed margins But Eyskens said this coordination raised a whole range of technical problems and ministers would discuss these further in Luxembourg in June on the basis of proposals from the EC s Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors He said the EC needed a set of indicators of economic convergence betwen Community countries and it was important that interest rates fulfilled this role together with exchange rates and inflation rates The Belgian minister whose country presently holds the presidency of the community made clear the meeting had not produced any agreement to move radically forward in developing the EMS towards the EC s long term goal of economic and monetary integration We have committed ourselves to reestablishing the normal functioning of the system Eyskens said Eyskens has repeatedly stressed that he believes the EMS has to be reinforced if the EC s plans to liberalise all movements of capital across national borders by are to go ahead EC executive Commission President Jacques Delors told the meeting the authority would put forward proposals for a final phase of capital market liberalisation in October that would include safeguard clauses for member countries for which the move would create difficulties Eyskens said the ministers and central bankers also discussed the need to dedramatise realignments of EMS parities by letting high ranking monetary officials carry them out by telephone rather than calling a meeting of finance ministers However West German sources said Bonn Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg was unenthusiastic about the idea British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told journalists that one of the technical issues raised by greater coordination of exchange market intervention was the question of which currencies should be used to intervene and held in central bank reserves He said several EMS member countries believed the EMS would work better if central banks held each other s currencies an issue of particular importance regarding West Germany since the Bundesbank holds only dollars in its foreign exchange reserves He said the debate on dedramatising EMS realignments reflected a general feeling among participants that the way the January reshuffle had been conducted was unsatisfactory The realignment was marked by acrimony between France and West Germany with each side blaming the other for strains in the system that forced the parity overhaul REUTER"

"U S OFFICIALS DISAGREE ON REDUCING BUDGET DEFICIT","Senior U S Economic officials disagree on the likelihood the government can meet its budget deficit reduction targets Beryl Sprinkel chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers reiterated the Reagan Administration s opposition to a tax increase and its pledge to reduce the deficit by cutting spending and fostering economic growth By contrast Rudolph Penner Director of the Congressional Budget Office said the budget process has broken down and the deficit will remain close to billion dlrs for fiscal Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York University that spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on the desire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibility for local projects to state governments He also suggested a line item veto which allows the President to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it to limit wasteful spending Spending and taxing decisions should be linked more closely Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for pct growth in U S Real gross national product GNP in and pct in Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of economic growth is attainable Sprinkel said It looks pretty good to me We ve had two very strong employment reports He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate adding It looks like they re on track While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact The new tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax reform act of significantly lowers tax rates and will greatly increase private production incentives he said Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest national net output of goods and services will permanently increase by approximately two pct because of the long run consequences of tax reform Sprinkel said In this would have amounted to an increase of approximately dlrs in the income of the average American family Sprinkel also argued the tax cuts were not responsible for the large increase in the budget deficit In fiscal ending September federal spending amounted to pct of GNP while federal receipts absorbed pct of GNP leaving a deficit of pct he said Sprinkel said that compared with fiscal the federal expenditure share of GNP is percentage points higher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same Contrary to the conventional wisdom therefore the tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget deficits of the past few years Sprinkel said This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation induced tax increases that occurred between and he added However the Congressional Budget Office s Rudolph Penner argued that the tax cut in was misguided Since making the big mistake in of cutting taxes enormously without any plan to decrease spending by the Administration or Congress indeed with increases in defence spending now all the options for reducing the budget deficit are unpleasant he said Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological turmoil in the U S Caused by the biggest sustained inflation in our nation s history which helped foster widespread distrust of government The American people turned on the government with tax revolt at the state level and new demands on the government at the national level Penner said But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike of spending programs Now the correction of that mistake demands that the system change a lot Penner sees little hope the Gramm Rudman Hollings budget deficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will remain at roughly billion dlrs this year He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is not likely to succeed I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to dictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply because there s no Way to enforce it Penner said Penner questioned the methods by which the budget deficit was cut He said to billion dlrs were eliminated by one time measures such as a temporary increase in taxes related to tax reform and sales of government assets Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creative timing changes like moving the military payday from the last day of fiscal to the first day of fiscal That saved more than two billion dlrs Penner said REUTER"

"AFTER G ROUND ONE GOES TO CENTRAL BANKS","Central banks have easily beaten back the foreign exchange market s first test of the industrialized nations recent pact to stabilize currencies analysts said In active trading this week the market pushed the dollar sterling the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar higher But operators got their fingers burned as one by one the central banks signalled their displeasure So far G has been a roaring success said James O Neill financial markets economist at Marine Midland Bank NA The central banks are sending strong signals that they won t tolerate any kind of momentum building behind currencies added a senior corporate trader at one U K bank On February the finance ministers and central bank governors of the U S Japan West Germany France and the U K the Group of Five plus Canada signed an accord under which they agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates around prevailing levels The agreement was viewed by many in the market as an attempt to put a floor under the dollar after its sizeable two year decline against major world currencies And initially traders indicated their respect for the accord by refraining from pushing the dollar lower But by Wednesday the dollar climbed to more than marks about five pfennigs above its levels the Friday before the G accord The move was aided by indications that the U S economy picked up steam in February at the same time as the West German economy was regressing But dealers said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York gave traders a sharp reminder that the G pact had encompassed the idea of limiting inordinate dollar gains as well as declines Dealers differed as to whether the U S central bank actually intervened to sell dollars above marks or simply telephoned dealers to ask for quotes and enquire about trading conditions But the dollar quickly backed off It hovered today around marks The market was surprised that the Fed showed its face so soon said Marine Midland NA s O Neill Also on Wednesday London dealers said the Bank of England intervened in the open market to sell sterling as the U K currency rose to dlrs compared with dlrs before the G pact Sterling along with the other high yield currencies like the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar was in favor after traders surmised that the the chance of intervention pursuant to the Paris currency accord left limited room for profit plays on dollar mark and dollar yen The pound also was boosted by suggestions of an improving U K economy anticipation of a popular British budget on March and public opinion polls showing good chances for the incumbent Conservative party in any general election There was a real run on sterling said Anne Mills of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc Sterling traded today around dlrs down from dlrs last night It slid to marks from yesterday and from a peak of about recently There s been some heavy profit taking on sterling mark ahead of next Tuesday s U K budget said James McGroarty of Discount Corp As speculators detected the presence of the U S and British central banks they acclerated their shift into Canadian and Australian dollars But here too they were stymied The Bank of Canada acted to slow its currency s rise The Canadian dollar traded at per U S dollar today down from yesterday And the Australian Reserve Bank using the Fed as agent sold Australian dollars in the U S yesterday dealers said The Australian dollar fell to a low of U S cents today from a high of Thursday Analysts said the central banks moves to stifle sudden upward movement leave the market uncertain about its next step Today the focus shifted to the yen which has held to a very tight range against the dollar for several months The dollar fell to yen from last night Analysts said the yen also gained as traders unwound long sterling short mark positions established lately Because of the change in perceptions about the health of the German economy the funds from those unwinding operations are ending up in yen a dealer at one U K bank said Recent West German data have shown falling industry orders lower industrial output and slowing employment gains Moreover the yen is benefitting as Japanese entities who have invested heavily overseas for example in Australian financial instruments repatriate their profits ahead of the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March Noting that the dollar yen rate is in a sense the most controversial one because of the large U S trade deficit with Japan analysts said the stage could be set for another test of the dollar s downward scope against the Japanese currency In its latest review of the foreign exchange market through the end of January the Federal Reserve revealed that it intervened to protect the dollar against the yen on January On that day the dollar fell as low as yen Sure the Fed bought dollars near the yen level in January But the market has to bear in mind that time marches on and the

"COCOA LATEST FOCUS FOR COMMODITY PACT NEGOTIATORS","The credibility of government efforts to stabilise fluctuating commodity prices will again be put to the test over the next two weeks as countries try to agree on how a buffer stock should operate in the cocoa market government delegates and trade experts said Only two weeks ago world coffee prices slumped when International Coffee Organization members failed to agree on how coffee export quotas should be calculated This week many of the same experts gather in the same building here to try to agree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work The still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding the International Tin Council ITC which had buffer stock losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling is also casting a shadow over commodity negotiations The ITC s failure has restricted negotiators ability to compromise as governments do not want to be involved in pacts with built in flaws or unlimited liability but want clear lines drawn between aid and trade A more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basic elements of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in Geneva at the weekend Some importing countries insist the International Cocoa Organization ICCO buffer stock rules must not be muddied with quota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa to be bought One consumer country delegate said this would distort not support the market Trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the ICCO for destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffee prices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts can founder On Friday this uncertainty helped push London cocoa futures down to eight month lows The strength of sterling has also contributed to the recent slip in prices The ICCO daily and average prices on Friday fell below the must buy level of SDRs a tonne designated in the pact which came into force at the last ICCO session in January but without rules for the operation of the buffer stock Consumers and producers could not agree on how it should operate and what discretion it should be given The agreement limits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says it cannot operate on futures markets A cash balance of some mln dlrs and a stock of almost tonnes of cocoa enough to mount large buying or selling operations were carried forward from the previous agreement Members finance the stock through a dlrs a tonne levy on all cocoa they trade It has an upper limit of tonnes The key arguments being faced by the ICCO working group on buffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will be over non member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock should pay when trading different types of cocoa Another working group is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss administrative matters and the full council meets on Thursday Producers have so far maintained that buffer stock funds should not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non member countries such as Malaysia Consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the buffer stock should buy it rather than compete with chocolate manufacturers for premium priced high quality cocoas The argument over buying non member cocoa is closely linked to the one over differentials for different qualities European industry and trade advisers have suggested as a compromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that can represent non member cocoa and that it use the London futures market s existing differentials for different qualities Currently good West African cocoa is tendered at par onto the London market Discounts which are currently under review range up to stg a tonne for Brazilian and Malaysian cocoa Consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse would operate when prices are high the buffer stock should sell the highest priced cocoa in most demand forcing all prices lower The January talks were slowed by a split inside the European Community a key ICCO consumer group with France siding with producers EC representatives met in closed session in Brussels on Friday in an attempt to reach a common ground and a diplomatic source said narrowed the range of positions among the nations The source said the EC will be looking for signs of flexibility on the part of producers in the next few days and will be able to respond if they are there One ICCO delegate describing the producer consumer split said consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less and backs the concept of the pact which is meant to support the market where trade buying is not In contrast he said producers seem to want to sell their cocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers Other more technical issues still outstanding include whether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced posted price as in the previous pact or by announcing it is buying then accepting offers In either case delegates said it is accepted that producers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers of cocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in a way that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers REUTER"

"TRADE INTERESTS READY FOR BATTLE IN U S HOUSE","U S lawmakers are gearing up for a showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the full House of Representatives in late April In a move to toughen U S enforcement of trade laws a key House subcommittee last week approved a toned down version of legislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices The bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts to restore competitiveness of American industries and turn around last year s record billion dlrs trade deficit Generally the bill s provisions toughen U S enforcement of trade laws The trade bill forces the administration to act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices such as dumping products in the United States at prices below cost of production It also forces the administration to act rapidly when an industry complains that a surge in imports threatens its existence In writing the bill the subcommittee rejected calls for trade relief for specific industries such as textiles Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too many concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back amendments to get tough with countries that violate trade agreements or keep out U S products But congressmen known for their allegiance to free trade said the bill ties Reagan s hands too much in trade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiating powers Bill Frenzel R MI said the subcommittee s bill was not one that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects but he emphasized there was a consensus among lawmakers to work toward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse The goal of trade legislation was to make our trade policy stronger without violating our international trade agreements he said In a key concession made at the urging of Ways and Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski D IL the trade subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced Reagan to impose automatically quotas or tariffs on imports from countries that engage in unfair trade practices It also agreed the president may waive any retaliation if it would hurt the U S economy Rostenkowski insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law Reagan last year blocked Senate consideration of a tough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year he only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he saw Democratic leaders were determined to pass such legislation White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters late last week that the administration still did not like some of the bill s provisions but he added Generally we feel very good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade legislation I think we are progressing very well The first battle will take place next week when the full House Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep Richard Gephardt D MO to force countries like Japan South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the U S The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices but would not automatically set off retaliation Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition AFL CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the administration when he said any trade bill Reagan would sign would not be worth passage in Congress But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate by saying I m not trying to write legislation to please Lane Kirkland I m trying to write legislation that will be signed by the president Rep Ed Jenkins D GA intends to push separately a bill to protect the domestic textile and shoe industry an aide said Reagan vetoed a similar measure last year House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas one of the most influential proponents of aid for specific industries beset by low priced foreign competition last week renewed his call for import relief for the domestic oil industry and announced his support for a Senate plan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption Reuter"

"U K BUDGET SEEN BOOSTING GOVERNMENT BOND MARKET","Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson s budget contained virtually everything the government bond gilts market had hoped for and is likely to help prices race ahead in coming months analysts and traders said Indeed in the first half hour after Lawson completed his speech gilt prices soared about points an extremely sharp gain in such a short period of time Overall they rose about two points on the day This budget was incredibly bullish for the gilts market Morgan Grenfell and Co Ltd economist Stephen Bell said Analysts said that in the light of the reaction to the budget in the gilts and U K Money markets U K Commercial bank base rates are likely to be cut by as much as a full point tomorrow Analysts said the market s euphoria was simply a reflection of supply and demand The crucial piece of news in the budget was that the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement would be held to billion stg By comparison a year ago the PSBR was set at billion stg The lower PSBR means the Bank of England will have to offer far less new stock to the market to meet its funding needs and the scarcity factor is sure to drive prices up further analysts said The PSBR at four billion is lower than anyone realistically expected Bell said Most market expectations called for the Chancellor to announce a PSBR of about billion stg S G Warburg Securities Co Ltd economist John Shepherd said that overall the Bank will have to sell about two billion less in new securities next fiscal year a cut of about pct in total new issue volume Chase Manhattan Securities Ltd international economist Andy Wrobleski noted the Bank has already raised about billion stg of next year s funding needs this year via a series of tap issues The issues have been in a partly paid form where the full price does not have to be paid until the start of the new fiscal year and therefore they are not counted in the current year s fund raising But the Bank of England will also be constrained from issuing gilts in the conventional form by its promise to try out a U S style auction system in which firms bid for new stock The Bank will also have to offer at least one index linked issue where the rate paid to investors is tied to the Retail Price Index leaving about one to two billion stg in total to be raised in the form of traditional stock Analysts noted that the budget contains provision for a two pence in the pound cut in the basic rate of income tax in line with most market expectations although some operators had expected a cut of up to four pence in the pound The gilts market approved of the more modest tax cut Shepherd said because If it was more than two pct they would have become concerned about the economy heating up again Also a cut of two pence in the pound suggests that if the ruling Conservative party is re elected another two pence cut can be offered at budget time next year Analysts said the gilts market may also be building steam on the political implications of the budget which suggests an early election All the goodies in this budget will be in place by the middle of May Morgan Grenfell s Bell said This makes a June election very likely Bell said some politically popular provisions omitted from the budget such as lifting the ceiling on the amount of mortgage eligible for tax benefit and some provisions on pensions could not have been implemented until autumn anyway At that rate they would have been of little use for a political party expecting to call an election in June Also analysts noted the budget does not go overboard with measures that are seen as generous to the wealthy This will be a difficult budget for the opposition Labour party to attack Shepherd said REUTER"

"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT U S DEFICIT WITH NICs","The U S trade deficit with Taiwan and Korea is expected to widen this year despite some economic and currency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries economists said The surpluses that Taiwan and Korea ran with the U S in will get bigger This time next year the U S will be screaming at those countries about their exports said Steve Cerier of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co Taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the U S after Japan and Canada while Korea is the seventh largest Faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in Congress the Reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric against Taiwan and Korea urging those countries to allow their currencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade The thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized countries NICs amid signs the dollar s steep drop against the currencies of Japan and most EC nations previously the main focus of the U S drive to cut its trade gap is beginning to close the competiveness gap for American goods U S Treasury secretary James Baker said recently that he expects a reduction in Japan s trade surplus this year But U S manufacturers still are losing markets on their own doorstep to Taiwan and Korea whose currencies have not risen as much as the yen and the mark As major beneficiaries of soft oil prices and with low labor costs Taiwanese and Korean exporters are well placed to take up the slack In the fashionable comment in Washington was Japan bashing Now it s NIC bashing said Robert Chandross of Lloyds Bank PLC Asia s four main NICs Hong Kong South Korea Singapore and Taiwan accounted for almost one fifth of the overall billion dlr U S merchandise trade deficit for The U S trade gap with Taiwan rose to billion dlrs in from billion in while the bilateral trade deficit with South Korea grew to billion from billion And preliminary U S data show that the growth trend is continuing The U S trade shortfall with Taiwan was billion dlrs in January up pct from a year earlier The gap with Korea was mln dlrs up pct from a year ago Lately both nations have said they will take steps to defuse incipient trade tensions Korea said it is choosing many of the items on which the U S wants it to cut import tariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation Still South Korean trade minister Rha Woong Bae said last week that Korea would maintain a trade surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its billion dlr foreign debt For its part Taiwan said in January that it will cut tariffs on goods sometime in the second half of and try to diversify exports But vice economic minister Wang Chien Shien said last month that he still does not expect Taiwan s trade surplus with the U S will fall in The NICs have made deep inroads into markets for textiles and electronic goods But Korea is raising its profile in the area of big ticket manufactured goods notably cars Korea expects its auto exports mostly for North America to balloon to units in from zero in The NICs exports are almost all manufactured goods When their exports rise it hits the heart of the U S manufacturing base It cuts directly to us and to our customers said Bob Wendt manager for economic studies at Bethlehem Steel Corp The U S takes pct of Korea s computer products exports pct of its electrical appliances and pct of its telecommunications equipment A recent study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co says Taiwan and South Korea are the most pressing trade issue for the U S While Hong Kong and Singapore run trade surpluses with the U S these are offset by their deficits with other countries But Taiwan and to a lesser extent South Korea stand in marked contrast Both of these nations have moved rapidly into large bilateral surplus with the U S and major overrall trade and current account surpluses the Morgan study says Morgan expects Taiwan s overall trade surplus to grow to billion dlrs in from billion last year and Korea s to increase to billion dlrs from billion Concern about the NICs is not confined to the U S A lot of Korea and Taiwan s exports to the U S have been at Japan s expense said Richard Koss at General Motors Corp February s Paris meeting of six major industrial powers exorted NICs to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies But this two pronged approach has drawn little response from the two nations so far and in any case will only work with a sizeable lag economists say The U S has not said how much it thinks the Taiwan s and Korea s currencies should climb The Taiwan dollar which is pegged to the U S dollar has risen about pct since September while the Korean won has risen about five pct But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat against the U S unit and the won has lost seven pct economists say We ve not seen any lessening of competition from those countries that we can attribute to currency changes said Bethlehem Steel s Wendt And so far U S pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use their hefty export earnings to import more have had little effect Moreover it is uncertain how far U S protectionism will get given the administration s free trade stance It s hard to see that anything will be passed much before year end And then the question is will it have teeth one economist said Reuter"

"EC MAY OFFER INTERVENTION SUGAR TO LOCAL MARKET","Sugar which EC producers plan to sell into intervention may be offered by the European Commission for sale within the Community broker C Czarnikow says in its latest sugar review The Commission will propose to offer the sugar at a very nominal premium of European Currency Unit Ecu to the intervention price with detrimental consequences for producers returns Czarnikow says The move is seen as an attempt to persuade the producers to take back the surrendered sugar The Commission may also take other steps to dissuade producers from their chosen course such as removing the time limit on storage contracts which presently means that intervention stocks have to be removed by the end of September Czarnikow says There is also the possibility of production quotas being reduced If the Commission decided to offer the sugar to traders for export the restitutions would have to be higher than those at recent export tenders Czarnikow notes To match the difference between the EC price and the world market price the extra costs might be as much as Ecus per tonne it says The producers might have to repay these costs through production levies and the proposed special elimination levy Czarnikow says but it would be several months before any costs could be recovered under EC rules The primary cause of the plan to sell tonnes of sugar into intervention in France is dissatisfaction with the EC export program as the restitution has increasingly failed to bridge the gap between the EC price and the world market price Czarnikow notes The French move is thus seen as a form of protest designed to force the Commission s hand In West Germany tonnes have been tendered for intervention but Czarnikow says the motive here is to ensure that the price is paid for sugar that was produced in In addition to a two pct cut in the intervention price West German producers face a further price reduction in July with a probable revaluation of the green mark Even if the immediate crisis is resolved the problem is not expected to disappear permanently It has appeared to traders for some years that the EC s export policy is insufficiently responsive to changing patterns of demand it says The weekly tenders should respond to fluctuating demand by increasing or reducing the tonnage awarded Czarnikow says suggesting that the Commission might also take steps to cut down the amount of unnecessary bureaucracy surrounding the export tender system Reuter"
"GERMAN BANKS SEE LOW INTEREST RATES CONTINUING","The Association of German Cooperative Banks said in a financial survey that domestic interest rates would continue to remain low for the time being It said the Bundesbank could hold them down despite strong foreign influence and it saw no interest straining factors in the economy that could affect the long term capital market The inflation rate of one pct also gave no occasion for higher nominal interest rates But a probable rise in inflation late this year could give very slight grounds for a rise in nominal rates at year s end and next year it said The association said generally low interest rates prospects of lower taxes a stable dollar rate and expected strong domestic demand led it to believe that the investment climate would remain friendly and the economy would continue its slow but very sure growth The Bundesbank had managed successfully to keep interest rates down on the short term money market although its policies had exerted little effect on the long term capital market which was so important for investment financing and thus for the course of the economy it said In view of the limits to the possibilities monetary policy had in influencing the longer term capital market the association saw little sense in wanting to boost the economy through a short term and expansionist monetary policy On the other hand it also saw no reason for sticking dogmatically to the money supply target for the whole of The association said time would show to what extent speculative foreign money and short term invested domestic money would distort money supply developments The Bundesbank could hold down money market rates with the highly effective instrument of sale and repurchase transactions it said Reuter"

"MAIN FEATURES OF NEW RUBBER PACT","The new International Natural Rubber Agreement INRA like the pact will use a buffer stock as the sole instrument for market intervention excluding export quotas or production controls The new INRA was adopted yesterday at a session held under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development UNCTAD In many respects the main features in the new pact resemble those contained in the present one The reference price currently Malaysian Singapore cts per kilo will be maintained unless between now and October when the INRA expires the average of the daily market indicator price remains above the upper intervention may sell price cts or below the lower intervention may buy price cts for six months If this happened but delegates said it was unlikely considering that the present indicator price averages cts the price would be revised under the current accord by five pct or by whatever amount the International Natural Rubber Council decides The new reference price would then be taken over for the new agreement Under the same circumstances in the new pact the reference price would be automatically revised by five pct unless the Council decides on a higher percentage Similarly if buffer stock purchases or sales amounting to tonnes have been made since the last revision the reference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unless the Council decides on a higher percentage Another change introduced in the new INRA is that price reviews will be held at month intervals instead of Those changes are intended to make the reference price more responsive to market trends As in the present accord the may buy and may sell levels are set at plus or minus pct of the reference price and the must buy and must sell levels at pct of it The lower and upper indicative prices floor and ceiling prices will remain fixed at and cents unless the Council decides to revise them at reviews held every months During the negotiations consumers abandoned a proposal that the floor price be adjusted downward if the buffer stock currently tonnes rose to tonnes The maximum size of the buffer stock in the new pact is the same as under the present one tonnes with provision for an additional contingency buffer stock of tonnes Under the new accord the contingency buffer stock will be brought in at cts to defend the floor price At last Friday s session Ahmed Farouk speaking for producers said producing nations considered that the pact had served the purpose for which it had been created Gerard Guillonneau of France who spoke for consumers agreed that the current agreement had worked relatively well Asked about the chances of success of the new INRA delegates noted that for nearly its whole life the accord had maintained the average price above the must buy level They said the agreement until now did not appear to have encouraged excessive production of rubber In addition provisions for borrowing to finance the buffer stock have now been eliminated ruling out speculation It is a sort of middle of the road agreement one delegate said The new pact will be open for signature at U N Headquarters in New York from May to December this year To become operational it will require ratification by countries accounting for pct of world exports and pct of world imports Delegates estimate that this will take to months from now During the hiatus between the two agreements the International Natural Rubber Council will remain in place The pact will enter into force definitively when governments accounting for pct of world exports and pct of world imports have ratified it REUTER"

"CONABLE WARNS PROTECTIONISM MIGHT SPREAD","World Bank President Barber Conable expressed concern that trade protectionism at the heart of a new showdown between the United States and Japan might spread throughout the industrial world But in an interview with Reuters Conable said the action by the United States to slap tariffs on certain electronic goods from Japan did not mean the countries were heading for a full scale trade war Conable said the World Bank has been pressing developing countries to open their markets arguing that a free trading environment increased the possibility of global economic growth We have in fact been making adjustment loans to many countries in the developing world which have encouraged the opening of their markets and we want to be sure that the developed world doesn t close at the same time he said He said the U S action against Japan was a significant retaliatory step but it did not constitute a basic change in trade policy The interview came just before next week s semi annual meetings of the Bank and the International Monetary Fund Referring to Brazil s recent interest payments moratorium Conable also said the global debt situation was very serious and must be closely watched He said the Bank which in the past has concentrated on making loans that assist the basic underpinnings in the developing world such as dams roads and sewers will increasingly make assistance available for economic reform The Bank has increased these loans in part because of the debt crisis that has found countries desperately in need of new funds for balance of payments adjustment and economic reforms aimed at opening their markets encouraging foreign investment and reducing government s role in the economy We re comfortable with adjustment lending we expect however that it will never reach a majority of our portfolio Conable said He made clear however that adjustment lending would continue to increase as a proportion of overall Bank lending for some time He noted the problem of debt was a severe one and many countries are asking for adjustment assistance because of the problem of debt Conable is a a former Republican Congressman from New York chosen by President Reagan for the Bank position last year He is an associate of Treasury Secertary James Baker who launched the U S strategy for shoring up indebted nations in October which included a call for increased adjustment lending by the World Bank Conable also said that he expected the result of a major study of the Bank s organization to be completed in the next several weeks He said the decision to seek a reorganization was based in part on the fact that the Bank had come under fire from the poorest countries for not doing enough to help and from the richest countries because of inefficiency the reorganization is considered a major initiative by Conable and is being closely watched by the agency s member countries as an indication of his management style and priorities I want to be sure this institution is viewed by those who must support it as soundly constituted so that it will be permitted to grow Conable said However he said I don t believe there is anything basically wrong with this institution and I don t believe it has to have any redefinition of its purpose He said however that it was apparent that the debt initiative proposed by Baker has given the Bank a central role in dealing with the debt crisis Conable added that cooperation between the Bank and its sister agency the International Monetary Fund was good and that he talked often with IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus on a variety of issues On a personal level Conable said that he not feel a need to put his personal stamp on the Bank noting that I don t have a particular mission here except to be useful to the institution and to the process of development He added so I don t feel a great calling to personalize the institution On the development needs of sub Sahara Africa Conable said that the Bank was constantly reviewing new ways for assisting the region noting that half of the recently agreed financing of billion dlrs for Bank s International Development Association was earmarked for Africa Leading industrial nations are expected to consider new forms of debt relief for the very poorest nations like those in the Sub Sahara during next week s meetings Reuter"

"IWC SAYS EFFECT OF LOWER SUPPORT PRICES LIMITED","Efforts by governments to control wheat surpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partial success the International Wheat Council IWC says in its latest monthly report Faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducing both price and areas as employed in the United States the IWC says in a survey of support prices in the five main wheat exporters Argentina Australia Canada the EC and the U S In some countries for example Australia and Argentina which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for export income there may be problems in reducing production A policy of cutting wheat production could lead to unemployment with job prospects outside agriculture limited Alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could then lead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems The IWC outlines three courses of action open to governments in wheat exporting countries They could continue to support prices in the hope that when the world economy improves demand for wheat will rise and surpluses wil be reduced or eliminated Alternatively support could be limited to wheat which could be easily sold without needing to be stored for a long period This option may prove to be the most politically unattractive and would result in many producers abandoning wheat production the report said The third option would be for governments to distinguish between the commercial and social aspects of agriculture possibly varying support prices according to farm size or overall production The IWC review covers support prices in the major exporting countries since At some time during that period all the producers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses These changes did not always result in lower export subsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more than offset lower prices in the domestic currency For example between and the EC intervention price for bread wheat fell from to European currency units Ecus It dollar terms the currency in which most export transactions are denominated the intervention price however rose to dlrs from The high cost of supporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers and some governments are now searching for ways to cut expenditure the report says The proportion of world wheat output produced by the five major exporters declined in the period covered by the survey from pct in to pct in This was partly due to increased production in China and India The period saw an upward trend in yields although this was countered in the Argentina the U S And Australia by lower acreages In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about per cent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch to other enterprises particularly livestock while lower U S Acreages are attributed to official incentives REUTER"

"BRITISH BANKS RESIST SIGNING MEXICO PACKAGE","British banks are resisting signing a billion dlr rescheduling package for Mexico in a last ditch effort to get all participants to contribute equally to a new billion dlr loan contained in the package Christopher Brougham regional manager rescheduling unit at Lloyds Bank Plc said in response to a Reuter enquiry that the six major U K Clearing banks last week sent a telex to Citibank saying they would contribute what was requested provided all other major lenders did the same and that the U S Banks contribute at least pct of the amount required by them Other bankers who declined to be identified said other groups of banks particularly those in Switzerland France and Canada were equally reluctant to sign although they had not sent any telex to Citibank which chairs Mexico s bank advisory group However they said it was likely that if and when the British banks sign the accord the others are likely to follow Under the agreement for which the signing began on Friday commercial banks are being asked to contribute pct of their exposure to Mexico as of August That was the date of the first Mexican debt crisis After months of haggling a proposed rescheduling agreement for Mexico was struck last September during the annual meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in Washington Ever since then the advisory group of which Lloyds is a member has been attempting to round up the needed signatories However there has been considerable resistance to the package partly because of some of the clauses it contains and partly because many small U S Regional banks do not want to increase their exposure to any Latin American countries Brougham said We British banks have always played along for Mexico and will do so as long as others share equally The decision to send the telexes was agreed on by the six clearers jointly but each sent its own telex In addition to Lloyds telexes were sent by National Westminster Bank Plc Barclays Bank Plc Midland Bank Plc tandard Chartered Bank Plc and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc Brougham noted that so far the U S Banks have only reached pct of the total that is expected from them while the level of contributions from the U K Banks is well in excess of pct The U S Figure should be closer to ours he said Many bankers have been angered by the resistance of the regional U S Banks noting that even if they don t contribute to the new loan they still will be receiving interest on the existing loans The banks still have three weeks to sign the agreement and bankers are hoping all will go according to plan In the meantime bankers expect further pressure will be exercised on the regional banks and the major U S Banks to find a solution to the problem Many have suggested that the larger U S Banks should take on the additional obligations but so far they have resisted this Bankers expect that much of the pressure on the U S Banks will come from U S Regulators notably the Federal Reserve Bankers prefer to view the stance taken by the British banks and other national groups as a matter of principal and burden sharing rather than as a pressure tactic to force the U S Banks to make up their share The bankers are not the only ones to be upset by the protracted negotiations surrounding the agreement The Mexicans themselves have been angered by the delays At the signing in New York last Friday Finance Minister Gustavo Petricioli sounded a warning to the recalcitrant banks Those who supported us today can be sure that Mexico will continue to be open and willing to share with them the business opportunities which its future growth will create Petricioli said Conversion of bank debt into equity investments in Mexico is one option banks can take advantage of to reduce their exposure But Mexico halted its debt for equity program in February in an effort to concentrate on finalising the package On Friday Petricioli said We will be a lot more expeditious in processing the requests of banks that have supported us The pressure on the U S Banks comes at a time when other major Latin American debtors are in the process of crucial debt negotiations Brazil the third world s largest debtor has suspended all interest payments on its billion dlrs of foreign debt Many of the major U S Banks including Citibank have already said they might have to put their Brazil loans on a cash basis and take the financial losses which could total billions of dollars This would be required by U S Banking regulations if the interest payments are more than days overdue However the U S Banks are not the only ones threatened by regulations In the U K A proposed Inland Revenue ruling would affect the tax treatment of certain types of loans many of which are made to Latin American countries Basically the ruling wants to limit the tax credit a bank can claim for tax withheld by foreign governments on loan interest payments The British banks are planning to fight the proposals as their implementation could prove extremely costly not just in terms of compliance but in limiting future business REUTER"

"U S APPEARS TO TOLERATE FURTHER DLR DECLINE","In a bid to hasten Japan s promise to speed up its economic growth and open markets to foreign trade top U S officials appear once again to have signaled their tolerance of a lower dollar Treasury Secretary James Baker and one of his top aides Assistant Secretary David Mulford said last week there was no target for the dollar a statement that sent the yen soaring against the dollar despite massive central bank intervention That was no slip of the tongue said one western monetary official who asked not to be identified For now the strategy appears to be working Japanese officials said late last week a package to bolster domestic demand will be ready in early April Until last week there were few indications the package would be ready anytime soon The Reagan administration facing an uproar in Congress over the apparent lack of progress in cutting the billion dlr trade deficit is learning now that to extract results from Japan dramatic action is required Last week the White House imposed unprecedented tariffs on certain Japanese electronic goods after Tokyo failed to adhere to a semi conductor pricing accord between the two countries The shift in U S strategy in part designed to appease mounting Congressional anger over Japanese policies comes just two weeks before industrial nations reconvene here to review the Paris agreement to stabilize currencies And news that Japan earned a record billion dlr trade surplus in the first two months this year just underscored the need for urgent action in the view of U S officials Nonetheless U S officials see signs of improvement in the deficit I d be stunned if we were not going to derive some benefits from the lower dollar soon said one In Paris leading industrial nations agreed to cooperate closely to foster currency stability within ranges reflecting underlying economic fundamentals or economic reality The agreement envisages those fundamentals to include Japan and West Germany stimulating their economies and the United States cutting its budget deficit The three nations joined by France Britain and Canada agree these policies are essential to redress huge global trade imbalances But analysts say markets have signalled the underlying fundamentals imply a lower dollar rather than a stable one Markets in effect are less confident than governments that these measures including U S budget deficit cuts agreed by Congress and the White House will be carried out Nonetheless the dollar s sharp fall has not undermined cooperation A U S economic policymaker said the accord was on track and Tokyo and Bonn seem to want more stimulative measures which is what the Paris accord calls for International monetary sources said exchange market developments generally have not unsettled policymakers although Japan is an obvious exception Everybody feels it can still be managed one source said of market developments But last week the Bank of Japan spent an estimated five billion dlrs intervening to halt the rise in the yen and other central banks about one billion dlrs Another monetary source said Japan was upset with America s half hearted attempt to halt the falling dollar flouting the Paris accord outright The source close to the top levels of Japanese economic policymaking said Japan s understanding of the accord was that the yen would be kept at around to the dollar the level it stood at when the accord was struck The source said Tokyo was extremely worried by Washington s use of the exchange rate to change Japanese policies It was a pointed reminder to Japan to do something about the trade issues the source said of the dollar s fall against the yen By departing last Sunday from the language of the Paris accord that nations agreed to foster currency stability around current levels Baker triggered a run on the dollar Later in the week Mulford too said there was no target for the dollar and called on Japan and West Germany to live up to their international responsibilities and stimulate growth But U S officials said recent market developments will not unravel the spirit of the Paris agreement There s a realisation now that you cannot leave things alone everyone agrees that the external trade imbalances ought to be adjusted one official said While no one is going to cede national sovereignty we certainly seem to be moving towards much closer co operation another U S official said The officials said the meeting here where the six will be joined by Italy will be a status report Japan will have to explain what the state of their program is and Germany will report on its plans Maybe there s a need to move faster one source said Mulford told Congress last week the Paris accord called in effect for currency stability for several months This would buy time for Japan and West Germany to speed up their economic growth and help bring down the U S trade deficit His comments appeared to serve notice on other major nations that Washington cannot wait too long for action to reduce the gap between the Japanese and German trade surpluses and the U S trade deficit Reuter"

"COMMODITY PACTS MORE ORIENTED TOWARDS MARKET","Consuming countries chastened by the collapse of International Tin Council ITC price support operations in are insisting more than ever before that commodity pacts reflect the reality of the markets they are serving a Reuter survey showed They want price ranges to be more responsive to market trends to avoid overstimulating output and straining the accords support operations and intervention rules that avoid the risk of exports by non members undermining the pacts Consumers and producers mindful of ITC buffer stock losses have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations Importers and some key exporting countries have shunned a generalised approach to commodity price stabilisation and prefer to assess each commodity case by case the survey showed The International Cocoa Organization ICCO last week set precise limits on what the Buffer Stock Manager BSM could do under the new agreement It imposed daily and weekly purchase limits prohibited the BSM from operating on futures markets and stipulated after consumer insistence that up to pct of total buffer stock purchases could be of non member cocoa This will help prevent lower quality cocoa from Malaysia the world s fourth largest producer undermining the market The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the Buffer Stock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades A new International Natural Rubber Agreement INRA was adopted earlier this month in Geneva Importing and exporting countries agreed several changes to make the reference price more responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisions under which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to finance operations Direct cash contributions from members will fund buffer stock purchases Bank financing was a particular feature of the failed ITC buffer stock which suffered losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling Legal wrangles continue Recent International Coffee Organization ICO negotiations in London exemplified the degree to which consumers insist that agreements reflect market reality commodity analysts said Consumers and a small group of producers argued that objective criteria should be used to define export quota shares which would have meant a reduction in the share of Brazil the world s leading producer Brazil wanted to maintain its previous quota share of pct The talks broke down and although an ICO executive board meeting starts in London today delegates and trade sources see chances of any near term negotiations on export quota distribution as remote International agreements exist for sugar and wheat These do not have any economic clauses but provide a forum for discussions on possible future economic agreements collect statistics and draw up market analyses Analysts said differences between sugar exporting countries have held up any progress towards an accord with economic teeth while sheer competition between major exporters amid a world grain glut militate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat An alternative focus for commodity discussions are international study groups made up of governments with advice from industry such as those for lead and zinc and rubber The U N Common fund for commodities with a planned directly contributed capital of mln dlrs has failed to become operational because neither the U S Nor the Soviet Union has ratified it U S Officials in Washington said the U S Doubts the fund would be able to fulfil its objectives citing the lack of widespread support U S Officials in Washington and Malaysian officials in Kuala Lumpur expressed a policy of looking at each commodity pact case by case U S Officials said it has been willing to study individual cases for economically sound market oriented commodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests We see little to be gained by attempting to increase the price of a commodity whose long term trend is downward official Administration policy states The U S Currently belongs to only two international commodity agreements that have economic clauses the International Coffee Agreement ICA and INRA but it is also a member of the sugar and wheat pacts The U S Did not join the International Cocoa Agreement because it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic and not designed to protect the interests of consuming countries the State Department said U S Officials singled out the INRA as the one commodity agreement that seems to be working U S Negotiators were successful in getting other members of the pact to agree that the price review and adjustment mechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflect market trends and also to continue the accord as a market oriented agreement U S Officials said Canadian officials in Ottawa also said they have consistently tried to look at membership of commodity pacts on the merits of each case Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik told Reuters

Producing Countries ATPC which produce pct of world tin The ATPC launched a plan to limit member tin exports to tonnes for a year from March to cut the tin surplus to from Economist in the West German Ministry of Agriculture and delegate to cocoa wheat and sugar agreements Peter Baron told Reuters in London Agreements with economic clauses to stabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges were close to market reality if there was full participation by producers and consumers and if participants were prepared to take their obligations in the framework of the agreement seriously But Baron added No real sanctions are available for a country that doesn t stick to its obligations The German approach is sceptical We don t think agreements are the best instrument to help developing countries They were never meant to be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how developing countries often interpret them Traditionally Britain has always been supportive of commodity agreements reflecting its strong links with Third World producing countries But recently demands for more stringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the need for intellectual honesty and objective criteria have grown British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be a two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid It is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct market participation through a buffer stock have a high degree of transparency and do not contain the risk of open ended borrowing that occurred in the tin pact they said U K Delegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices to reflect changes in market structure and price trends rather than dictate what prices should be A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said Japan urges price realism in commodity pacts adding high prices inflate supply A government spokesman in Paris said France is favourable to commodity pacts France a large consumer and producer of sugar favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the real market situation particularly regarding stocks Indonesia s Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja told Reuters in Jakarta These agreements can work as long as the problems are cyclical But it s another matter when there are structural problems But we are still committed to commodity agreements as an act of faith Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said in London producers cannot afford not to give their backing to commodity agreements The political will is not there on the part of some consumers to make agreements work Martinez Cuenca said The head of the economics department in the Brazilian Foreign Ministry Sebastiao do Rego Barros told Reuters an agreement can be successful if it keeps a link with market reality If you have an agreement such as coffee with a system of quotas with a link between prices practised inside the pact and actual market prices it can work UNCTAD spokesman Graham Shanley
